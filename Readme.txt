Lead our hero into the underground of the old space station to blow up the entire complex and wipe out its evil inhabitants.
But beware, the environment is dangerous. 
Avoid coming into contact with the enemies, and falling into the lava or radioactive waste pits.

To successfully complete the mission you must obtain the 10 explosives that are scattered around the station, and place them in the explosives depot, deep inside the martian base.
Once deposited, you must return to the control centre and activate the detonator.

Sometimes you will have to access locked areas with access cards, so you will have to locate these cards before you can continue your mission.

You have the possibility to fire plasma bullets against your enemies, but be careful, don't waste ammunition is scarce.
There are refills scattered throughout the complex. 
Reserve some ammunition for the way back.

Available oxygen is very scarce. 
Keep an eye on the condition of your oxygen tanks and find new ones before they run out or you will die on the spot.
Reserve some oxygen for the return.


ENEMIES
=======

INFECTED: Previous companions who attempted the mission and failed. 
The bite of the arachnoviruses keeps them in an undead state.
They move in a linear fashion and can be very fast. 
Take them out before they infect you.

ARACHNOVIRUS: Erratic and fast moving.
They usually move through the air. 
They are the most numerous aliens that have colonised the base.

PELUSOID: They are very intelligent. 
They can remain crouched waiting for your arrival.
If they see or hear you, they will pounce on you.
In that case finish them off as soon as possible. 
It is best to keep your distance.
